        in the 'first step' page of the macro.
Step 5. While logged in, also download the reports for the month.
Step 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the 5 different logins.

Step 10. A file dialog - folder picker will appear. Select the 'Benevity' folder.
Step 11. The macro will do all of the following, going through each file one by one within the given folder:
         1. Consolidate all of the report data into the macro file.
         2. Transform the report by adding in the table details from the 'Benevity' website - for the accounting team's side of the process.
         3. Rename all of the files based on: School, Disbursement Date, Disbursement ID, and Net Amount.
         4. Break apart line items based on Company Matching or Employee Giving (2 transactions may be on 1 line item on the report)
         5. Transform the data into a 'Salesforce Import File'.
